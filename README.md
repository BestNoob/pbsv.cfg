# pbsv.cfg
Server PunkBuster Config for Call of Duty, Battlefield etc.

You can checkout my Serverlist on Discord: https://discord.gg/A7vtjmw


Most Admins dont know how or are to lazy to configure PunkBuster. But without configuring, PB is only a lame dog.

This Config should give you the best protection for your Server.

You can edit settings as you wish, only the sky's the limit. But be aware that this config is universal, some settings might not work with all games, you have to test it.

Here you can find some Guides https://www.pbbans.com/information-center.html

Following games using PB and can be protected with actual Cheat detection signatures by using PBBans, GGCStream, ACI streaming services.
